Python Google Voice Library

Based on pygooglevoice by Joe McCall & Justin Quick.


Exposing the Google Voice “API” to the Python language
------------------------------------------------------

Google Voice for Python Allows you to place calls, send SMS messages, download voicemail data, and programmatically browse your Google Voice accounts’ respective various folders.
Among other things, you can use the Python API or a command-line script to schedule calls, check for new recieved calls and SMS messages, and even sync MP3s of your recorded calls and voicemails.
